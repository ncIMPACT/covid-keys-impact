# Background

Moving your organization from information to action during a crisis with no clear modern standard is tricky. Most communities are biasing towards responsible action to meet their citizen's needs by leaning on measures they feel uniquely capture and tell the story of COVID-19 impacts on their community. Referrals through 211, evictions, late property tax payments, public safety calls for service, and permit issuances are some of the data points beings used to understand real-time fluctuations and impact.

Some of these data points may resonate as you reflect on conversations, decisions, and innovations in and around your jurisdiction over the last ten months. We have seen and discussed many tough decisions such as eliminating merit increases, cutting out new or existing positions, delaying capital projects, and implementing hiring freezes. We have also seen and heard incredible stories of innovative adaptations and service evolutions happening across the country at all levels of government.

# Efficacy of Action

If we are being completely honest with ourselves, we know that the true effectiveness of these metrics and actions will not be empirically known for quite some time. It is also apparent that hyper-local considerations reign supreme which makes it almost impossible to convey universal truths when discussing data. That does not mean that communities should be waiting for researchers to give them definitive guidance about what the best metrics or actions are. They are acting exactly as they should, trusting and leveraging their local subject matter experts on the front lines to innovate, adapt, and evolve in real-time.

Given all of this, you can see how difficult it might be to provide reasonable and relevant data-informed decision making support for jurisdictions across the state. In the face of so much uncertainty though, what we have noticed is a consistent framework for moving from information to action being almost unconsciously discussed and employed by local leaders.

# Indicators

This framework involves a nuanced and layered approach which includes quantitative insights that consider community resilience, the infusion of emergency financial support, and real-time fluctuations in a focused set of metrics.

What we have compiled for you here, is a non-comprehensive selection of indicators that we see as tremendously relevant to the recovery landscape for communities in North Carolina. The indicators are not just intended to be informative but rather are constructed with this framework in mind for how communities in North Carolina might think about making tough decisions over the next six to twelve months to prioritize limited resources.

Our COVID Composite combines publicly available data to construct a composite understanding of where economic growth and recovery may be most challenging and where communities may be at the greatest risk of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and widening inequities. This composite approach is also intended to be representative of the complex operating context for local government and the intricate social fabric in communities that makes it almost impossible to adopt a one-size-fits-all understanding.

In accordance with the framework described, our composite is constructed in three layers:

1.  Developing an understanding of a community's resilience and/or disposition towards widening inequity using publicly available Census data at the Census Tract level.

2.  Developing an understanding, where data is available, of the emergency financial support resources received which may be masking short-term consequences and delaying second-order impacts of the pandemic at the county level.

3.  Developing an understanding of real-time fluctuations in a selection of publicly available indicators at the county level.
