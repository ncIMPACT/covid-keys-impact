# Background

Making data-informed decisions during a crisis with no clear modern standard is incredibly difficult. Most communities are biasing towards responsible action to meet their citizen's needs by leaning on measures that they feel uniquely capture and tell the story of COVID-19 impacts on their community. Referrals through 211, evictions, late property tax payments, public safety calls for service, and permit issuances are all being used to understand real-time fluctuations and impact. Using this data, we are hearing stories daily of incredible adaptations and service evolutions happening across the country at all levels of government. We also know, through direct engagement with practitioners and media sharing positive stories of collaboration across the country, that this crisis is unlocking access to innovation for actors at all organizational levels.

# Efficacy of Action

If we are being completely honest with ourselves though, we know that the efficacy of these measures will not be empirically known for quite some time. Conversations with community leaders have also revealed feelings that short-term consequences of the pandemic are being masked by emergency financial support and the worst is still yet to be seen.

That does not mean that communities should be waiting for researchers to give them definitive guidance about what the best metrics are. They are acting exactly as they should, trusting and leveraging their local subject matter experts on the front lines to innovate, adapt, and evolve in real-time. This understanding is what pushes us towards what we feel may be more appropriate and actionable data support for organizations across the state seeking to make data-informed decisions given limited and shrinking resources.

# Guiding Question

Drawing from the context just provided, direct qualitative conversations with local leaders, surveys, and webinar engagements, we have developed what we feel is a strong guiding question to direct our focus.

> *How might we use data to develop an understanding of delayed consequences, real-time fluctuations, and community resilience to direct our attention towards possible areas of disproportionate impact?*

# Composite Metric

Our contextual understanding and this guiding question have helped us develop a nuanced approach. Our approach combines publicly available data to construct a composite understanding of where economic growth and recovery may be most challenging and where communities may be at the greatest risk of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and widening inequities. This composite approach is also intended to be representative of the complex operating context for local government and the intricate social fabric in communities that makes it almost impossible to adopt a one-size-fits-all understanding.

Our composite is built in three layers:

1.  Developing an understanding, where data is available, of the emergency financial support resources received which may be masking short-term consequences and delaying second-order impacts of the pandemic
2.  Developing an understanding of real-time fluctuations in a selection of publicly available indicators
3.  Developing an understanding of a community's resilience and/or disposition towards widening inequity using publicly available Census data

Please refer to the composite definition tables for a detailed understanding of the data used to build these layers and how that data was obtained.

# Composite Application

Data for layers one and two is only available and will be gathered at the county or city level. Data gathered at the city level will be applied to the county containing that city. This data will be compiled and evaluated first. Data for layer three will be gathered at the census tract level to provide communities across North Carolina with more granular insight.

Thresholds will be developed for each data point in all three layers (i.e. greater than NC poverty rate) to determine if that data point will be included in a census tract's composite score. Scores at the county level from layers one and two will be applied to census tract scores in layer three based on the county containing that census tract.

The maximum possible composite score will thus be equal to the total number of data points compiled across all three layers. Higher composite scores will indicate areas at greatest risk of disproportionate
impact due to COVID-19.
