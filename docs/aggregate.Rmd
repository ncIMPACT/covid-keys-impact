## Computing Scores

Once individual metric z-scores are all computed, the metrics can then be aggregated into a composite layer total z-score. Displayed here are maps showing, at the county and Census Tract levels, the aggregate z-scores for the three separate composite layers.

For additional reference information and guidance on z-scores, please refer to our [Metric Standardization documentation.](https://ncimpact.github.io/covid-keys-impact/standardize.html)
